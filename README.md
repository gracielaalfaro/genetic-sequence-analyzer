# genetic-sequence-analyzer
Intermediate bioinformatics project â€” DNA analysis, FASTA parsing, and ORF detection using Python
<br>
This project contains three Python scripts for analyzing DNA and protein sequences.
<br>
## ðŸ§¬ Part 1: DNA Triplet Analysis
- Calculates total sequence length
- Counts frequency of each triplet (codon)
- Computes genetic complement

## ðŸ§« Part 2: FASTA Parsing with Gene Metadata
- Parses sequences from `human.fa`
- Enriches them with gene synonyms and locations from `protein-coding_gene.txt`
- Outputs formatted FASTA entries
- Each sequence is modeled using a Python class

## ðŸ”¬ Part 3: Open Reading Frame (ORF) Analysis
- Parses DNA sequences from `dna.fasta`
- Identifies longest and shortest sequences
- Detects the longest ORF in each reading frame (1, 2, 3)
- Reports ORF positions and lengths

## ðŸ’» Skills Demonstrated
- Python scripting
- File parsing and I/O
- Object-oriented programming
- Bioinformatics logic (complements, ORFs)
- Data representation and frequency analysis
